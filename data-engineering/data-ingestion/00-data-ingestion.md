# Data Ingestion
Data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage. Data can be streamed in real time or ingested in batches. In real-time data ingestion, each data item is imported as the source emits it. When data is ingested in batches, data items are imported in discrete chunks at periodic intervals of time.

Broadly, at SimplePractice our data ingestion pipelines can be split into two categories: 

- **Product Data Ingestion Pipelines** — deals with the ingestion of data from our own applications into Snowflake for analytics purposes
- **3rd Party / External Data Ingestion Pipelines** — deals with the ingestion of data from outside applications (SaaS, etc) into Snowflake for analytics purposes
